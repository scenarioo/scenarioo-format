# Images for the Scenarioo Format Documentation

This folder contains all the drawings that are made with the draw.io web drawing application.

## Edit Pictures

To edit a drawing, just go to https://www.draw.io and open the XML file of the drawing you want to change.

When you are done with your changes, you have to save it again in the same XML (overwrite it!) and also export the drawing as an image and store it in this folder again, by simply overwriting the existing PNG and / or SVG file.

Then commit all the changed files.
