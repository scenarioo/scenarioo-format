This folder contains all the drawings that are made with the draw.io web drawing application. To edit a drawing, just go to https://www.draw.io and open the XML file of the drawing you want to change. When you are done with your changes, you have to export the drawing as an image and store it in this folder again (overwriting the existing PNG file). Then commit the changed XML and PNG files.
