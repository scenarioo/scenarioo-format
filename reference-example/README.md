# Scenarioo Documentation Format - Reference Example

This reference example directory contains an example of a scenarioo documentation directory file structure as it should be producable by all libraries that support writing this format.

All libraries that implement a Scenarioo Writer should implement some tests to verify that all these same files with exactly same content and in same file structure can be produced easily by using these libraries. A library is considered feature complete, if, and only if, it can produce this same output.

When we change or add features in the scenarioo format, we will adopt this reference example, such that it should allways contain all possibilities that need to be tested and supported by all the libraries.
